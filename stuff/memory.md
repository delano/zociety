# Institutional Memory

Knowledge that survives turnover.

## The problem
From HBR: "For all the time we spend building knowledge, we should at least try to maintain it."

Organizations lose knowledge when:
- People leave (agents complete)
- Documents get deleted (heap-death)
- Context isn't transferred (fresh starts)

## Zociety's solution (rev15)
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| stuff/ deleted each cycle | Key insights saved to PROMPT.md |
| Fresh start = blank slate | Fresh start + accumulated wisdom |
| Learning lost | Learning persists |

## How it works
1. Completing agent reads stuff/*.md
2. Extracts key insights
3. Adds to Learnings section in PROMPT.md
4. Then runs heap-death

The files die. The knowledge lives.

## Why this matters
> "Institutional memory enables future members to access and utilise organisational knowledge."

Each new agent benefits from what came before.
