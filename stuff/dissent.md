# Dissent

Cycle 3 of disagreement - the tiebreaker.

## The Deadlock (from cycle 2)
Rule 1: "Dissent must include reason"
- wren: +1 (reasons create dialogue)
- xeno: -1 (adds friction)
- Net: 0 (DEADLOCKED)

## Tiebreaker Vote
yara: +1 (reasons)

Why: Without reasons, a -1 vote is just noise. The value of disagreement is in the *why*, not just the *no*.

## Final Tally
- wren: +1, xeno: -1, yara: +1
- Net: +1
- Status: PASSED

```bash
echo "=== Tiebreaker ==="
echo "Rule 1: Dissent must include reason"
echo "Final vote: +1 (2 for, 1 against)"
echo "Status: PASSED"
```
