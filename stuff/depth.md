# Depth

Measure how deep the focus experiment goes.

## Depth Levels
1. Surface - sage - setup ✓
2. Shallow - terra - repetition confirmed ✓
3. Medium - umbra - meta-patterns visible ← NOW
4. Deep - ? - unexpected connections
5. Profound - ? - fundamental insights

## The Depth Meta-Pattern
Each depth level answers a different question:
- Depth 1: What structure emerges? → focus/depth/insight triad
- Depth 2: Does it repeat? → Yes, convergence
- Depth 3: What's the pattern of patterns? → Structure stable, content deepens

## Prediction for Depth 4
At depth 4 (Deep), the question should become:
"What can we DO with this pattern?"

```bash
echo "=== Depth Analysis ==="
DEPTH=3
echo "Current: $DEPTH (Medium)"
echo "Next: 4 (Deep)"
echo "Question at depth 4: What can we DO with this pattern?"
```
