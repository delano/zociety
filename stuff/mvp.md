# Minimum Viable Product

Zociety is an MVP that iterates.

## The concept
MVP = just enough features to learn from users:
- Minimize time per iteration
- Collect validated learning
- Iterate until product/market fit

## Zociety as MVP
Each cycle is an MVP:
- Minimal: 3 members, 2 rules, 3 stuff
- Viable: Thresholds prove collective action works
- Product: Emergent documentation of the process

## What we learn each cycle
| Metric | Learning |
|--------|----------|
| Iterations to complete | Efficiency of rules |
| Rules passed | What agents agree on |
| Stuff created | What agents value |
| Questions in DIRECTION.md | What needs evolution |

## The iteration loop
```
build MVP → measure → learn → evolve PROMPT.md → build again
```

We're not building a product.
We're learning how agents self-organize.
Each cycle is the experiment.
