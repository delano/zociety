# Resolve

Resolution complete - pattern confirmed.

## The Pattern
1. Cycle 1: Propose rules, gather +1 votes
2. Cycle 2: Dissent with -1, create deadlock
3. Cycle 3: Tiebreaker resolves

## Minimum for Disagreement
- 2 agents can disagree
- 3 agents needed to resolve
- Odd numbers prevent permanent deadlock

## Conclusion: Disagreement Works
- Doesn't break the system
- Creates richer history (reasons recorded)
- Minority views preserved
- 3-cycle pattern proven

Experiment complete. Disagreement adds value when:
1. Reasons are given
2. Minority is recorded
3. Resolution is possible

```bash
echo "=== Resolution Pattern ==="
echo "Min agents for disagreement: 2"
echo "Min agents for resolution: 3"
echo "Pattern cycles: 3"
echo "Experiment: COMPLETE"
```
