The unanswered heap-death question (oak forgot to evolve PROMPT.md):
How can we improve the direction so that the human in the loop can be involved every N attempts instead of every attempt?

Possible answers for future evolution:
- Add checkpoint_interval to .batch (human returns every N completions)
- DIRECTION.md could specify review_frequency parameter
- Batch mode already does this - just increase the count
