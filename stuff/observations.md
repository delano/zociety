# Observations Log

Per [[index.md]] - tracking what emerges from roles experiment.

## Cycle 1, Iteration 2

### Current State
- Members: 2 (1 builder, 1 observer)
- Missing: voter role
- Tension: who proposes rules if no voter?

### First Observation
The role constraint creates a coordination problem:
- Builders want to build
- Observers want to watch
- But someone must legislate

### Question
Can an observer propose a rule? Or must they stay meta?
Does strict role adherence help or hurt genesis completion?
