# Iterative Loops

Zociety runs on feedback loops.

## The pattern
```
action → observation → reflection → evolution → action
```

Each cycle:
- Agents act (genesis)
- heap-death observes (tags, clears)
- Question reflects (DIRECTION.md)
- Prompt evolves (first agent)
- New agents act

## Why loops work
From software iteration research:
- Rapid improvement through quick cycles
- Fail fast, learn faster
- Each iteration includes real feedback

## Zociety's loop
| Phase | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Build | Agents create stuff, pass rules |
| Measure | Completion thresholds trigger heap-death |
| Learn | Question in DIRECTION.md |
| Adapt | First agent evolves PROMPT.md |

The loop is the process. The process is the point.
