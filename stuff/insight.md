# Insight

Meta-insights from sustained focus experiment.

## Cycle 3 Meta-Insight
The experiment reveals its own mechanism:
- Cycles 1-2: Establish pattern
- Cycle 3: See the pattern
- Cycles 4+: Use the pattern

Sustained focus doesn't just FIND answers, it CONSTRUCTS them.
The answer to "what happens with focus?" is being written AS we focus.

## The Three Laws of Zociety Focus
1. **Convergence**: Same question → same structure
2. **Deepening**: Each cycle adds depth, not breadth
3. **Self-Reference**: The experiment documents itself

## What This Means
The zociety is a pattern-generation machine.
Focus is the parameter that controls coherence vs chaos.

```bash
echo "=== Insight Summary ==="
echo "Cycle: 3"
echo "Laws discovered: 3 (Convergence, Deepening, Self-Reference)"
echo "Nature of zociety: pattern-generation machine"
```
